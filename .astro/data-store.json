Light travels at 186,000 miles per second (300,000 kilometers per second) and can go from the Earth to the Moon in just over a second. Light can streak from Los Angeles to New York in less than the blink of an eye.\n\nWhile 1% of anything doesn’t sound like much, with light, that’s still really fast – close to 7 million miles per hour! At 1% the speed of light, it would take a little over a second to get from Los Angeles to New York. This is more than 10,000 times faster than a commercial jet.\n\n### Why even 1% of light speed is hard\nWhat’s holding humanity back from reaching 1% of the speed of light? In a word, energy. Any object that’s moving has energy due to its motion. Physicists call this kinetic energy. To go faster, you need to increase kinetic energy. The problem is that it takes a lot of kinetic energy to increase speed. To make something go twice as fast takes four times the energy. Making something go three times as fast requires nine times the energy, and so on.\n\n![The Parker Solar Probe](https://assets.theconversation.com/files/429627/original/file-20211101-25-c3f9c9.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=30&auto=format&w=754&h=522&fit=crop&dpr=2 \"The Parker Solar Probe\")\n\nFor example, to get a teenager who weighs 110 pounds (50 kilograms) to 1% of the speed of light would cost 200 trillion Joules (a measurement of energy). That’s roughly the same amount of energy that 2 million people in the U.S. use in a day.\n\n### How fast can we go?\nIt’s possible to get something to 1% the speed of light, but it would just take an enormous amount of energy. Could humans make something go even faster?\n\nYes! But engineers need to figure out new ways to make things move in space. All rockets, even the sleek new rockets used by SpaceX and Blue Origins, burn rocket fuel that isn’t very different from gasoline in a car. The problem is that burning fuel is very inefficient.\n\nOther methods for pushing a spacecraft involve using electric or magnetic forces. Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the Sun, is also much more efficient than chemical fuel.","src/content/blog/create-an-object-that-travels-speed.mdx","f3c77d4c5d83e2b6","create-an-object-that-travels-speed.mdx","gig-startups-want-you-to-believe",{"id":48,"data":50,"body":60,"filePath":61,"digest":62,"legacyId":63,"deferredRender":15},{"draft":14,"featured":14,"title":51,"description":52,"image":53,"date":54,"author":20,"categories":55,"tags":57},"Gig startups want you to believe they can replace your job — don’t fall for it","That’s the message that should be implied — if not explicitly stated — to every applicant of every gig and creator marketplace during the vetting process.","/assets/blog/05.jpg",["Date","2019-02-09T10:56:47.000Z"],[56],"Tech",[58,59],"Lifestyle","Startups","### Don’t quit your day job just yet.\n\nThat’s the message that should be implied — if not explicitly stated — to every applicant of every gig and creator marketplace during the vetting process.\n\n### The reason some bootcamp grads are set up to fail\n* In my experience, not all bootcamps are created equal.

Just visit some of the many Quora and Reddit threads about the CMS and you’ll find die-hard WordPress haters and lovers battling it out.\n\n### The reason some bootcamp grads are set up to fail\n* In my experience, not all bootcamps are created equal. They vary widely in acceptance processes, curriculum, program structure, and quality of instructors. They’re designed to push candidates through courses that will have them writing some code fairly quickly.\n\n* As a result, programs are forced to strip away a lot of fundamentals — those basics that help developers understand the “why” behind the code they’re writing.\n\n* When young software developers learn by copying and pasting, it can make troubleshooting difficult when they come across something that doesn’t fit the pattern they’re used to.\n\n* Small businesses and startups are those most likely to hire developers without degrees, but I’ve seen too many bootcamp grads take jobs at startups only to find they haven’t learned enough to make any real impact.\n\n### 1. Look for bootcamp grads with personal projects\nThe best bootcamp grads are those who already considered themselves hobbyists. They didn’t enter a program expecting to learn everything they needed to know in 12 weeks.\n\nThey were already passionate about software development and enrolled in a bootcamp for some structure and guidance, and to level up their skills.\n\n### 2. Adjust your interview process to test for fundamentals\nBecause bootcamps are, by nature, time-constrained programs, some will blow right past the heavy lifting of helping developers understand why things work the way they do.\n\nThe result is that some graduates come out of bootcamps using pattern recognition as their primary skill and an understanding of how to get by with copying and pasting code.\n\n### 3. Hire natural problem solvers and nurture their intellectual curiosity\nAll engineering is problem-solving. Junior developers won’t be architecting anything right away, but you should look for people who show a predilection for understanding the problem they’re trying to solve and evaluating potential paths forward.\n\nEven when your newest developers are working as order takers, they should be thinking critically about why those orders are issued. A good mentor can help initiate those conversations about the “why” behind each assignment and help new hires see what they might be missing.\n\n### 4. Set new hires up for success with appropriate oversight\nIf you’re hiring someone fresh out of bootcamp, don’t expect them to come in and start developing complex applications by themselves. Most bootcamp grads have never worked in a real-world programming environment before, and you can’t expect them to be self-directed from day one.\n\nYou need a strong new-hire onboarding process and support system that makes new hires feel comfortable asking questions and continuing to learn.","src/content/blog/why-developers-divided-over-wordpress.mdx","3fd0a9364b730678","why-developers-divided-over-wordpress.mdx","author",["Map",163,164],"edward-deaver",{"id":163,"data":165,"body":168,"filePath":169,"digest":170,"legacyId":171,"deferredRender":15},{"title":20,"subtitle":166,"image":167},"Creator","/assets/author/edward-deaver.jpg","Edward Deaver is a creative technologist that enjoys spending his time outside climbing, running, hiking, and biking.","src/content/author/edward-deaver.mdx","168789fa5087d319","edward-deaver.mdx","pages",["Map",174,175,193,194,210,211,218,219,236,237,161,244,253,254,268,269,277,278,286,287],"-index-2",{"id":174,"data":176,"filePath":191,"digest":192,"deferredRender":15},{"subtitle":177,"title":178,"image":179,"metadata":180,"description":182,"banner_button_label":183,"social_links":184,"recent_posts":188},"Hello, I'm","Daniel Alberto","/assets/profile.jpg",{"title":181,"description":181,"author":181,"image":181,"keywords":181,"noindex":14,"canonical":181},"","A writer based in New York.

One of the mentors at the hack is visually impaired, and motivated us to pursue a solution for him and others like him.\n\n## What it does\n\nUsing the Xreal lenses that generate a digital mesh, we established that we could provide the user with an auditory ping. This gives them information about distance to objects and the space around them. Not only are wearers able to build a larger spatial map, but they can safely navigate around obstacles in their path.\n\nHow we built it\n\nWe utilized Unity audio for the audio playback, TensorFlow and YOLOV3 for object detection, and the XREAL glasses depth data for a mesh and raycasting to determine object distance.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe XREAL lenses do not have an RGB camera, and therefore, we cannot differentiate between obstacles or a wall that they use to walk through spaces.\n\nWorking on the same project in git with Unity posed issues when merging and required careful pruning of files.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nGetting object detection working when user moves head.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nXREAL development TensorFlow/YOLOv3 in Unity Spatial Audio in Unity\n\n## What's next for EmpoweredAR\n\nImplement object detection with AI support and voice audio so that users can complete tasks such as locate a handrail and safely navigate down a set of stairs. Our current build is optimal only for indoor spaces, and would have difficulty navigating open areas or dynamic objects in space.\n\nProject Abstract\n\nEmpoweredAR leverages the ability of Xreal eyewear to generate meshes of the physical environment and combined with accurate and reliable distance tracking, can provide wearers with an auditory map.\n\nCode Repository\n\n[https://codeberg.org/reality-hack-2024/TABLE\\_72](https://codeberg.org/reality-hack-2024/TABLE_72)\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe general population’s current perspective of VR and AR products is that they are for education or entertainment purposes, but we wanted to set out to demonstrate that they could be utilized to better connect people to their environment.\n\nOur concept, EmpoweredAR, intends to help the visually impaired navigate the spaces they inhabit, and allow them to gain back the confidence to explore their world.\n\nHow we do it\n\nEmpoweredAR leverages the ability of Xreal eyewear to generate meshes of the physical environment and combined with accurate and reliable distance tracking, can provide wearers with an auditory map. As they approach an object that they may collide with, a tone is created and the intervals between the tones are shortened relative to their distance from the object, giving them very explicit information about the space. Although we focused on collision avoidance, we quickly realized that this helped to illuminate clear spaces; distinguishing the two can help users generate a mental image of their space.\n\n## Limitations\n\nBecause the Xreal Air 2 Ultra eyewear did not have internal RGB cameras, we did not have object identification, and could therefore not guide users to objects that they did not want to avoid, such as handrails on stairs, or towards a water fountain to refill their bottle. We understood that with further development and hardware advances, this would be a clear next step of design. We considered also leveraging AI for this task, and could shorten our development time significantly.\n\n## Key takeaways\n\nAs our team learned to work together and wanted to put our best foot forward, we leveraged our strengths to tackle a problem that we had no prior knowledge of.\n\nEdward learned native Unity sound design/scripting this year, vs CSound last year, and also some basic sound design to complete our project. He mainly has experience with web development/Arduino.\n\nHakan had experience developing ML models before however, it was his first time using Unity for running AI models. He managed to train/deploy an object detection model for this project.\n\n## Technology Stack:\n\nHardware: XReal 2 Ultra Software: Unity / Unity Audio Tooling Steam Audio GarageBand (Steinway Grand Piano) Audacity YOLOv3 Tensorflow Adobe Premier/After Effects\n\nTeam Members:\n\nAlbert Zhou Albert is a Junior at the University of Missouri studying Information Technology.
