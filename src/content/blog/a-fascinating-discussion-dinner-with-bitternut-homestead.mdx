Dinner at Bitternut.

The housing market in Syracuse is broken (read the [Syracuse Housing Study](https://edwarddeaver.me/blog/a-fascinating-discussion-dinner-with-bitternut-homestead/Syracuse%20Housing%20Study)), like most places. The city is majority single-family land use for housing. Let's talk about the thing giving me hope. [Bitternut Cooperative Homestead](https://bitternutcooperativehomestead.wordpress.com?ref=edwarddeaver.me) is a great initiative by Frank Cetera to build a better model of housing in Syracuse. One that breeds community, affordable housing, and bettering the environment.

Let's talk about hope for a better future:

### Let's first define some terms:

* Co-op (Cooperative): "For practical intents and purposes, a co-op can be defined as a building that is jointly owned by a corporation made up of all its inhabitants. When you buy into a co-op, you’re not purchasing a piece of property – rather, you’re personally buying shares in a nonprofit corporation that allows you to live in the residence." ([RocketMortage](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/what-is-co-op?ref=edwarddeaver.me)) You may have interacted with one through smaller banks/credit unions. Or if you are in NYC, maybe you'll see these listed on [https://streeteasy.com/](https://streeteasy.com/).
* Intentional Community: You may have heard the term commune before especially in the context of 1960s/70s. They're different, "Cohousing is a type of “intentional community,” in which people make a conscious choice to live together as a group. However, it’s not the same thing as a commune, in which a group of families jointly own a plot of land and share all their income and other resources." ([MoneyCrashers](https://www.moneycrashers.com/communal-living-cohousing-types-benefits-intentional-communities/?ref=edwarddeaver.me)) Bitternut is an intentional community that is co-op housing, it's not a commune.

## What is Bitternut Homestead?

I don't think I can do this better than quoting the [prospectus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f5Q9fg_f_oiblZgi4_amXQb_Jfg_WRqH/view?ref=edwarddeaver.me).

"The Bitternut Homestead is located at 717 Otisco St, in the Near Westside, near downtown Syracuse, NY; and provides products and services, including:

* Shared Home - a 1,900 sq. ft. home with access to full kitchen, pantry, dining room, sitting/tv room, wood burning cast iron stove, multi-purpose room, home office space, half-bath/half-utility room, clothes washer, enclosed side-porch bicycle parking, attic and basement storage, private bedrooms, full bath on 2nd floor with walk-in shower and cast iron clawfoot bathtub, guest room.
* Affordability - 4 Residents at current $350 a month afford a whole 3-bedroom house at $1,400, under the neighborhood average of $1,446, while offering over double the space of an average apartment of 830 Sq. Ft.
* Edible Landscaping and Kitchen Gardening - All residents contribute 2 hours weekly to garden & landscape work. The value this returns is hard to measure but consider our garlic harvest as one example. By spending 2 hours together preparing beds and planting 100 cloves, we harvested 80 bulbs this year."

Check out their Instagram - if you are also vegetarian or just into urban farming check it out:

This was the first time I had actually met Frank in real life. Somehow we were connected on LinkedIn and I'd been following Bitternut Instagram. He's a nice guy, it's very clear he's genuinely passionate about this.

Also, this was the first time I had met the other guests at the table.

Frank made a great meal from veggies from their garden, a guava paste salsa from Cuba, and a wonderful gooseberry jam from the garden with the churro waffles.

David educated me on student housing [co-ops in Ann Arbor that was started in response](https://icc.coop/?ref=edwarddeaver.me) to a lack of affordable housing. Could students do that here?

Could the residents of Syracuse do that?  Well, they are and we'll get to that.

### Notes:

#### Other student housing groups:

*     [Cornell](https://scl.cornell.edu/residential-life/housing/campus-housing/upperlevel-undergraduates/cooperative-housing?ref=edwarddeaver.me)
  * Not fully related but Cornell has a whole website about co-ops in their general form and founding them. Very interesting stuff - [http://cooperatives.dyson.cornell.edu/](http://cooperatives.dyson.cornell.edu/?ref=edwarddeaver.me)
* [MIT](http://lgc.mit.edu/general_info?ref=edwarddeaver.me)

Lindsey told me about another co-op in Syracuse, [Bread and Roses](https://www.breadandrosescollective.org/,?ref=edwarddeaver.me), ([Facebook is more up-to-date](https://www.facebook.com/breadandrosescollective/)). As well as [Syracuse Grows](https://syracusegrows.org/?ref=edwarddeaver.me), a network of community gardens in Syracuse.

There was talk about the co-op model and how the shares work. Class A vs B and the roles and responsibilities included in them. I like how the higher the investment of money you put in (Class A) you get voting rights but to retain ideological investment there is also a work requirement in it.

Also, in general, there was talk about community and foraging for wild plants in the city.

Community is a key to their success, there is something very special happening there.

After learning about co-ops my mind is racing with ideas of could I start one?

So I've now rented ["Utopia Drive" by Erik Reece](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374710750/utopiadrive?ref=edwarddeaver.me) to learn about the current landscape of commune-ish intentional communities and[ "America's Communal Utopia's" edited by Donald E. Pitzer ](https://uncpress.org/book/9780807846094/americas-communal-utopias/?ref=edwarddeaver.me)to get a historical lens on it from the library.
