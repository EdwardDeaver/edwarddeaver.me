Last year I took a trip to Brooklyn Navy Yard for their open house: [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-house-new-york-weekend-at-the-yard-tickets-421606164387](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-house-new-york-weekend-at-the-yard-tickets-421606164387).

A lot of this trip was walking around and exploring the city, so most of this blog post will be too.

## Walking around:

Went up this beautifully long staircase at Fort Greene Park [https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/fortgreenepark](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/fortgreenepark.).

I think the gray/black bird is a woodpecker.

I really enjoyed this park.

### Onto the Navy Yard:

In the lobby was Jason Krugman’s LED sculpture in the lobby. [https://www.jasonkrugman.com/basket/](https://www.jasonkrugman.com/basket/)

There were a lot of companies and organizations open to tour. Besides HUSH I checked out most of them on the list. I really enjoyed [C﻿LIP Bike](http://www.clip.bike/) and B[ike New York & Recycle-A-Bicycle](https://www.bike.nyc/). Clip Bike was a lot smoother ride than I expected, and much easier to convert a bike via it than a Bafang Kit. Recycle-A-Bicycle was sweet because they were fixing up donated bikes and teaching people how to work on them. 

### HUSH:

There I met [Maddie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maddiehickey), [Joseph](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-mango/) and [John](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-noonan). 

Thank you to John for walking me through how projects were made and your tech stack. 

Hearing them all speak was incredibly informative, especially on the approach to projects. Learning about how they approach installations as a conversation with the client and spend so much time communicating with them about their wants/needs/progress/result. It was eye-opening as well to learn about how long their timelines are, and how collaborative their process is not just internally but with external vendors as well.

This was a really nice street to walk on. There was an outdoor restaurant down there. Wish Syracuse would shutdown Walton again. Streets are so much nicer without cars.

This reminded me of the stone slabs that make up the stairs of some old Syracuse parks like Lincoln Park. Also, this was a costly area lol. 

Really enjoyed my trip this time to Brooklyn and meeting so many new people. Highly recommend it. Also, staying in a hotel > AirBNB, and flying > Amtrak.
