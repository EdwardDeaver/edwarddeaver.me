Timelapse with sound added back in of the night.

Click Clack… it updated. 

A days before the election: At Syracuse’s Open Data Day met someone (not sure they want to be named) that told me The NY Times in years past published their election results via a JSON file that gets queried every couple minutes. I found a link to last years and built a script for my display around it. If that data is published in a similar way this year my script should work for this years election. 

Election night: The NY Times's election site is powered by \~5 json files and those JSON files are one of the few ways to get election data for free. At 6pm when the new data dropped, I changed the data structure to fit it.
