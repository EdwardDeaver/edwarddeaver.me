For Hack Upstate 2020 hackathon, I made a tool that emailed me when my webcam detected a Fedex or UPS truck, so I wouldn't miss package deliveries. Won 2nd place.

For my Hack Upstate 2020 submission (a 24 hour hackathon), I created a tool that emailed me when a Fedex or UPS truck was detected from my webcam. The goal was to not miss when a mail truck delivered a package. I received 2nd place.

It utilized [Google's Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/?ref=edwarddeaver.me) to train the model and TensorFlow/OpenCV to detect the trucks.

Some challenges I ran into were:

*     CUDA version support on my OS vs TensorFlow.
*     Trying to ingest an RTMP stream via a Wyze camera resulted in random crashes from inconsistent stream. The RTMP support for Wyze was in beta at the time.
