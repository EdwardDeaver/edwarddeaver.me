StarTup In Residence Startup in Residence is a program that connects governments with startups to solve government-led civic challenges.

While at the city of Syracuse I interned as a Storytelling Intern.

## StarTup In Residence

Startup in Residence is a program that connects governments with startups to solve government-led civic challenges. As a government partner in the 2018-2019 STiR cohort, the City of Syracuse has identified three different City challenges that we have three different start-up companies helping us to solve. In this video is Adria Finch(former Chief Innovation Office for the City of Syracuse).

## 2019 Priority Area: Permitting

"When people think about neighborhood development and economic development, they often think of construction, new buildings, renovations, small businesses, and jobs.  However, they don’t often think about the behind the scenes work that goes into those larger efforts.  People spend countless hours planning, working, and developing their projects.  They spend time and money to create something that will not only impact their lives, but the entire community."
