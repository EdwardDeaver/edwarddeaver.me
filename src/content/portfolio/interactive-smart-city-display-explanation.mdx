For my computer science capstone project, I created an IoT installation with the goal of making smart technology tangible and less intimidating to the public, for the Innovation Office at the City of Syracuse, (a small, start-up-like office in City government).

## Video of the website receiving data:

This was a Bootstrap website running on a NodeJS server on Heroku, that used SocketIO to receive data.

## Posters that I made:
