title: 'MIT Reality Hack 2023: Team Amadeus'
description: >-
  Amadeus is an interactive application that teaches you about waveforms via a
  repurposed Guitar Hero controller and an ESP32 connected to Unity via
  Bluetooth. Looking into the VR glasses, the Quest 2, you are immersed in a sea
  of particles visualizing the transformations of modulated waveforms.

## Team Amadeus

A tool for educating young people on the science of sound with hardware and VR.

In 2.5 days a team that didn't know each other made an experience that left people with smiles on faces.

This was our submission video to the judges.
