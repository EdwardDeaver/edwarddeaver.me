  description: |
    Edward Deaver is a creative technologist interested in the human aspect of technology and making the spaces we inhabit—physical and digital—better. With a versatile skill set and a passion for movement, he builds innovative, people-focused systems that span from immersive installations to intelligent backend APIs.

    Edward thrives at the intersection of hardware and software. He's fluent in Python, JavaScript, and C++, and works comfortably across modern frameworks like FastAPI, React, and openFrameworks. His toolbox includes Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, Blender, and Max/MSP, as well as hands-on tech like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and MIDI devices.

    Whether he's building AR experiences, reverse-engineering undocumented devices, or deploying cloud-native systems with AWS Lambda and API Gateway, Edward brings a builder’s mindset and a collaborative spirit to every project. He’s no stranger to AI tools like ChatGPT and Codeium, using them to synthesize documentation, accelerate development, and navigate the rough edges of under-documented systems—always with version control as a safety net.

    External Projects & Hackathons

    MIT Reality Hack 2023: Built a VR physics learning experience for Oculus Quest 2, integrating Csound and ESP32 hardware.

    Hack Upstate Fall 2020: Created a TensorFlow/OpenCV mail-truck detector that triggered email notifications based on real-world activity.

    City of Syracuse Innovation Team (Intern): Developed a real-time snowplow mapping prototype using MapQuest geocoding, Verizon GPS data, Tile38, and Leaflet.

    Professional Experience

    Full Stack Web Developer, Syracuse University
    Developed augmented reality experiences and social filters using TikTok Effect House. Built APIs and automation pipelines using FastAPI, Node.js, and GitHub Actions to eliminate multi-day manual processes.

    Splunk Engineer, Evolent Health
    Enhanced security operations through log analysis, data searching with Splunk and Cribl (similar to FluentDB), and Python apps for actionable insights.

    Athletic & Personal Interests

    Outside of work, Edward is deeply involved in competitive cycling, running, and rock climbing. His love for bikes goes beyond riding—he builds them, advocates for safer cycling infrastructure, and stays active in his local riding community.

    Recently attempted the Irreverent Road Ride (IRR) in Vermont, riding a rebuilt LeMond Poprad Disc.

    Has logged over 3,600 miles on Strava and uses tools like RideWithGPS for route planning and climb analysis.

    Combines tech and fitness: analyzing performance data, exploring training plans, and always looking for ways to improve the digital side of physical activity.

    Enjoys working with others—whether collaborating with external contractors or bouncing ideas off fellow technologists and riders.
